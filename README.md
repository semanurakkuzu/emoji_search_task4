Emoji Search
---

Created with *create-react-app*. See the [full create-react-app guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

I wrote 4 different tests for the emoji search project.

#Tested areas:
- The test code will check that the header section has been created successfully.
- The test code will check if the emoji list is created successfully when the app is first opened.
- The test code will check that when a filter is made the emoji list is regenerated accordingly.
- When any emoji in the test code list is clicked, it will be checked whether the relevant emoji has been copied.
